  - 2D ID algorithm
  - AStar
  - Cell filling

- Repository documentation, with reference to the 2D ID algorithm and rasterization algorithm

REQUIREMENTS FOR TURN SYSTEM

- TURN ACCUMULATOR REGENERATES AFTER EACH TURN
- THE MORE SPEED THE MORE FAST THE ACCUMULATOR REGENERATES
- WHEN THE ACCUMULATOR REACH A CERTAIN TRESHOLD, IT SHOULD BE YOUR TURN

- AN ENTITY WITH MORE SPEED SHOULD HAVE "MORE" TURNS
- ON A TURN OF X, IF IT INCREASES THE SPEED OF Y, AND C WAS BEFORE Y, IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT Y NOW IS BEFORE C, SO ITS THE TURN OF Y INSTEAD OF C
